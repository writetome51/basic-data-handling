This a super-simple package. Sorry, there's no index.js file, but you really don't need it.
All the files in this package are clearly named for what functions they contain.
Everything is in TypeScript, with transpiled JavaScript files included.

Contains only these functions:

checkTypeOf(variable, expectedType) // triggers error if variable is not expectedType

// All these return boolean:

isArray(data)

notArray(data)

isInteger(data)

notInteger(data)

isFloat(data)

isEmpty(arrayOrString)

notEmpty(arrayOrString)

I might add a few more functions in the future, or maybe not.  Haven't decided.
